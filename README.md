producer consumer pipeline with a queue-based implementation

main thread generates event, causing the producer to exit immediately

might play around with different queue sizes to simulate longer network access times (?)

Complex.py: Implements a Complex Class

Divide.py: Implements integer division using only addition, subractioh, and shift

max_profit.py: Given a set of prices for securities on diff days, calculate which buy and sell results in maximal profit

parity.py : compute the parity of a bit pattern

singleton.py: implementing a singleton design pattern

reach_end: reaching the end of an array positionally

swapbits.py: swapping the position of two bits in a string

transposematrix.py: transposing matrices in numpy

lcaa.py : compute the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree 

gridsearch.py: search a 2d array for a specific number: runs in O(m + n) time

minmax.py: compute the minimum and maximum of an array using 1.5n - 2 comparisons instead of 2n - 2 comparisons (which would be required to compute the min and max separately).
